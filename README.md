# UI
Make a Store UI with minimum two pages:
  - Product Listing
  - Product Details

### Requirements
 - The UI must be pretty and eye kind, you can use whatever you what to build the UI with. The project uses NextJS but SSR and SSG are not mandatory but it will be a plus.
 - You must consume the backend api. Do not touch this folder, just UI is needed. 


# Backend
The backend is a express server on nextjs. The endpoints to consume are:
  - /api/products
  - /api/products/:id
